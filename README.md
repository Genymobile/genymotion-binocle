==================

*An Android app showing Genymotion API usage.*

This is a simple app, but with instrumented tests demonstrating how to use Genymotion API to check reactions of your app on sensors changes.

# Why an API
Sometimes in your instrumented tests, you will want to test what happens in your app when sensors send back specific values.
As Android cannot fake sensors values, you will have to modify your code to mock them and create proxy objects for them.
This will add unwanted noise inside your project source code, making it less readable, and harder to maintain.

Genymotion API is there to help you on this!

As all our sensors are already mocked inside Genymotion, we created a Java API allowing you to manipulate sensors values directly from your instrumentedTests.

# How to use
How to use the Genymotion Java Api in your instrumentedTest project:
### 1) Add dependency
#### Maven
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.genymotion.api</groupId>
    <artifactId>genymotion-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
#### Gradle
```
instrumentTestCompile 'com.genymotion.api:genymotion-api:1.0.0'
```
#### Without Maven nor Gradle
Simply add the jar file to your "libs" folder.
[genymotion-api-1.0.0.jar](http://www.genymotion.com/download/com.genymotion.api/genymotion-api/1.0.0/genymotion-api-1.0.0.jar)

### 2) Usage
Then inside your instrumented test, get a reference to Genymotion object using:
```
Genymotion.getGenymotionManager(getInstrumentation().getContext())
```
You will then be able to access all sensors from the GenymotionManager. For exemple, the battery level:
```
genymotionManager.getBattery().setLevel(10);
```
You can find all available methods in the Javadoc:
https://cloud.genymotion.com/static/external/javadoc/index.html

### 3) Tips
Most of the time your app listen to sensor changes using listener, and it takes some times for the system to see that sensors values changed, broadcast the values to every app listening for them. This is how you can wait a period of time for all of this to happen:
```
try {
    Thread.sleep(5000); //Android need time to poll sensors and broadcast event.
} catch (InterruptedException ie) {}
getInstrumentation().waitForIdleSync();
```
If you want to ensure that your instrumented test is only executed inside Genymotion and not on a real device you can exit the test this way:
```
if (!Genymotion.isGenymotionDevice()) {
    return; //donâ€™t execute this test
}
```


# Examples
Here is some practical examples:

### Battery
An app must display a warning if the device is not plugged to a power source and has got less than 10% power left.

Here is the Fragment showing it: [BatterySampleFragment.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/main/java/com/genymotion/binocle/BatterySampleFragment.java)

Here is an instrumentedTest testing for the behavior: [TestBattery.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/instrumentTest/java/com/genymotion/binocle/test/TestBattery.java)

### GPS
An app must display a message if the device is localized near a specific place.

Here is the Fragment showing it: [GpsSampleFragment.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/main/java/com/genymotion/binocle/GpsSampleFragment.java)

Here is an instrumentedTest testing for the behavior:  [TestGps.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/instrumentTest/java/com/genymotion/binocle/test/TestGps.java)

### Radio
An app must display a message if the device is a nexus 4 device, as recognized by its IMEI number.

Here is the Fragment showing it: [RadioSampleFragment.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/main/java/com/genymotion/binocle/RadioSampleFragment.java)

Here is an instrumentedTest testing for the behavior:  [TestRadio.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/instrumentTest/java/com/genymotion/binocle/test/TestRadio.java)

### Id

An app must encrypt data using ANDROID_ID to avoid the backup data to be moved on another Android device.

Here is the Fragment showing it: [IdSampleFragment.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/main/java/com/genymotion/binocle/IdSampleFragment.java)

Here is an instrumentedTest testing for the behavior:  [TestId.java](https://github.com/Genymobile/genymotion-binocle/blob/master/binocle/src/instrumentTest/java/com/genymotion/binocle/test/TestId.java)
